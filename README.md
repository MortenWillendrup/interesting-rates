# Interesting Rates Code

*Thomas Viehmann <tv@interestingrates.de>*

In this repository I collect sample code around topics in financial
and risk modelling and interest rates in particular.

I mainly use [Jupyter](http://jupyter.org/) notebooks and [pytorch](http://pytorch.org/).

Highlights:

# Interest-Rate-Models
- A [one-factor CIR++ model (Cox-Ingersoll-Ross plus shift extension)](interest-rate-models/CIR.ipynb)
- A [one-factor Hull-White model](interest-rate-models/Hull-White-1f.ipynb)

# Yield-Curve
- A [small notebook on the Nelson-Siegel-Svensson method](yieldcurve/nelson-siegel-svensson.ipynb)

#### The fine print

Note that these models are provided for educational and informative

mathematical mistakes, bugs or other.

I have written them in my spare time / vacation and they do not
